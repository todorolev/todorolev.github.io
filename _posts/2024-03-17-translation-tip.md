I am Bulgarian. I am satisfied with my level of English. I can speak fluently, my reading of technical stuff is perfect and I am good at reading fiction. Still, sometimes when I have to write a formal text in English, I may want to improve my writing beyond my abilities. In such cases, this approach usually gives me excellent results.

1. I write the text in English as I think it looks good.
2. I use Google Translate to translate it from English to Bulgarian.
3. I read the result in Bulgarian and correct any essential errors.
4. Again I use Google Translate to translate the text back from Bulgarian to English.
5. I might need to make adjustments to certain words or their order, and typically the text appears flawless afterward. Now, I can also use AI to rephrase some parts, the entire text, or provide synonyms â€” it's super efficient.
